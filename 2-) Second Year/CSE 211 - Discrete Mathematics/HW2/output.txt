n
(a,a)(a,b)(a,e)(b,b)(b,e)(c,c)(c,d)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes. Because:(a,a) (b,b) (c,c) (d,d) (e,e) are found.
Symmetric: No. Because:(a,b) is found but (b,a) is not found.
Antisymmetric: Yes. Because none of the symmetric elements excluding the ones with the same two values are found. For example:(a,b) is found but (b,a) is not found.
Transitive: Yes. Because all the necessary elements are found.For example:(c,d) is found since (c,d) and (d,d) are found.
n
(a,a)(a,b)(b,a)(b,b)(c,c)(c,d)(d,c)(d,d)
Reflexive: No. Because:(a,a) (b,b) (c,c) (d,d) are found. (e,e) is not found.
Symmetric: Yes. Because all the symmetric elements are found for example:(a,b) and (b,a) are found.
Antisymmetric: No. Because:(a,b) is found but also (b,a) is found.
Transitive: Yes. Because all the necessary elements are found.For example:(c,d) is found since (c,d) and (d,d) are found.

Symmetric: Yes. Because all the symmetric elements are found for example:(a,a) and (a,a) are found.
Antisymmetric: Yes. Because none of the symmetric elements excluding the ones with the same two values are found.
Transitive: Yes. Because all the necessary elements are found.For example:(a,a) is found since (a,a) and (a,a) are found.
n
(1,1)(1,2)(2,1)
Reflexive: No. Because:(1,1) are found. (2,2) is not found. (3,3) is not found. (4,4) is not found.
Symmetric: Yes. Because all the symmetric elements are found for example:(1,2) and (2,1) are found.

n
(1,1)(1,2)(2,1)(2,2)(3,4)(4,1)(4,4)
Reflexive: No. Because:(1,1) (2,2) (4,4) are found. (3,3) is not found.
Symmetric: No. Because:(3,4) is found but (4,3) is not found.
Antisymmetric: No. Because:(1,2) is found but also (2,1) is found.
Transitive: No. Because:(3,4) and (4,1) is found but (3,1) is not found.
n
(2,1)(3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)
Reflexive: No. Because:none of the reflexive elements are found.
Symmetric: No. Because:(2,1) is found but (1,2) is not found.
