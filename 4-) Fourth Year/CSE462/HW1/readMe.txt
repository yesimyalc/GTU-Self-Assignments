I have 3 different scenes which have different objects with different animations.
Each scenario has a selection + 3 step mechanism to interact with the object
	Select the character
	First Step: Short Up Swipe => an animation (the animation is different for each different character in each scene)

	Third Step: Short Right Swipe => an animation (the animation is different for each different character in each scene)

In each secene there is a selectable object:
	Scene1: The character with the crown
	Scene2: The fox in the front
	Scene3: The character with the crown
To select them:
	First Step: Clear all previous selections => Long Up Swipe
	Second Step: Lock the screen => Long Down Swipe
	Third Step: Press on the character

9-) There is a 2 step mechanism to change scenarios with buttons.
