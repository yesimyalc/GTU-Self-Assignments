***Explanation of My Driver Codes:***


-mainHashSetTest: The driver code that uses HashSet with Strings and Integers to test all the HashSet methods.

-mainArrayListTest: The driver code that uses ArrayList with Strings and Integers to test all the ArrayList methods.
Also uses HashSet with Strings and Integers to test some methods that HashSet and ArrayList can be used together.
It also tests some of the exceptions.

-mainLinkedListTest: The driver code that uses LinkedList with Strings and Integers to test all the LinkedList methods.
Also uses ArrayList with Strings and Integers to test some methods that LinkedList and ArrayList can be used together.
It also tests some of the exceptions.

All of the driver codes are designed to make 2 main holders that will hold fruit names and 2 main holders that
will hold numbers. Syntax of the driver codes are almost the same but the outcomes of the methods might differ
because of the holder type. Also each driver codes might have more methods because some holders include more methods
or the driver codes might have different type of usage of the same method to test the methods even more. 
The reason why I made 3 different driver codes is to make the driver codes look less complicated.
